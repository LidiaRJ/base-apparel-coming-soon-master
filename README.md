## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- To set the right structure in html while having a form with an image as a button.
- Use the after pseudo element to style html code.
- To apply JavaScript to forms in order to make them functional and be able to display an error messages when any field is not filled correctly. 


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on interativity and functionality with CSS and JavaScript, and building up my experience based on the Mobile-first workflow.
